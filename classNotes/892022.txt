Maven - Maven is a build tool, which help us to build a project by managing the libreries using dependencies

Automation prereqs:
1. Are we going to reuse these test? - true
2. Are these tests return benefits? ROI (Return of Investment) - true
3. Will it run without help of human? - true
4. Do we have enough resources? Skillsets/ People/ Tools/ Time - true

What benefits we will get:
1. It can run nightly / after hours and can share result
2. we can monitor the application overnight
3. less human interaction
4. cost saving

Our Framework:
MANDATORY:
1. What types of test you are goint to engage? Functional UI Regression tests (Unit + Integration)
2. Whats libreries in the Framework? Open source - Selenium, TestNG, WebDriverManger, Maven Compiler, Apache poi
3. What type of framework ? Hybrid (TDD + DDD)
4. What is the design pattern ? POM - Page Object Model (Reusabilty, Readability, Maintainance)
--- 3000 Design patterns. 1. Behavioral, 2. Creational, 3. Structural
OPTIONAL: (Bonus Points)
5. Main - 
	BaseClass - In BaseClass we instansiate the driver with webdrivermanger and add pageload timeout, implicit wait, explicit wait, maximize, @Parameters, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod
	CommonClass - Common Actions such as : Input, Click, scroll, dropdown, getUrl, getText, etc. and resue them in object class
	Object classes - Page wise class where locators, methods, steps are defined
	Utils - ExcelUtils, configUtils to read data from excel file and properties file
	Loggers - Log all the events in console or in reporting file
	Reporting - to get a report after each execution extent report
6. Test - 
	We have all the tests that extends the basecalss where our driver has been initiated
	We use @DataProvider (Object[][], Iterator - ArrayList) to pass data thet we read from excel/database
7. We use properties file to pass some configurable items such as url , waits
8. End of the test we can check html report to see the result and share with the team
